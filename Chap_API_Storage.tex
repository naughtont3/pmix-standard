\chapter{Storage Support Definitions}
\label{chap:api_storage}

Distributed and parallel computing systems are increasingly embracing storage hierarchies to meet the diverse data management needs of applications and other systems software in a cost-effective manner.
These hierarchies provide access to a number of distinct storage layers, with each potentially composed of different storage hardware (e.g., HDD, SSD, tape, PMEM), deployed at different locations (e.g., on-node, on-switch, on-site, WAN), and designed using different storage paradigms (e.g., file-based, object-based).
Each of these systems offers unique performance and usage characteristics that storage system users should carefully consider to ensure the most efficient use of storage resources.

PMIx enables users to better understand storage hierarchies by defining attributes that formalize storage system characteristics, state, and other parameters.
These attributes can be queried by applications, I/O libraries and middleware, and workflow systems to discover available storage resources and to inform on which resources are most suitable for different I/O workload requirements.

\section{Storage support constants}

\declarestruct{pmix_storage_medium_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_storage_medium_t} is a \code{uint64_t} type that defines a set of bit-mask flags for specifying different types of storage mediums. These can be bitwise OR'd together to accommodate storage systems that mix storage medium types.

%
\end{constantdesc}

\declarestruct{pmix_storage_locality_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_storage_locality_t} is a \code{uint64_t} type that defines a set of bit-mask flags for specifying different storage localities. These can be bitwise OR'd together to accommodate storage systems that combine storage localities.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_STORAGE_LOCALITY_NODE}
The storage system resources are node-local.
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_STORAGE_LOCALITY_NETWORK}
The storage system resources are network-local (e.g., on the same switch).
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_STORAGE_LOCALITY_SITE}
The storage system resources are site-local (i.e., in the same datacenter).
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_STORAGE_LOCALITY_WAN}
The storage system resources are on the WAN (i.e., not site-local).
%
\end{constantdesc}

\declarestruct{pmix_storage_access_type_t}

The \refstruct{pmix_storage_access_type_t} type specifies different storage system access types.

\begin{constantdesc}
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_STORAGE_ACCESS_RD}
Provide information on storage system read operations.
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_STORAGE_ACCESS_WR}
Provide information on storage system write operations.
%
\declareconstitemNEW{PMIX_STORAGE_ACCESS_RDWR}

%
\end{constantdesc}
